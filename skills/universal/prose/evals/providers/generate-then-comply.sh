# Generation loop. A fact sheet goes in, the writer composes a paragraph under the
# prose contract, and a second session grades the paragraph against the contract,
# holding the fact sheet as the ORIGINAL.
#
# This is the compliance loop's counterpart for composition rather than editing.
# The rewrite loop can only measure restraint and repair on prose that already
# exists. A fact sheet has no sentences to preserve, so every fact the paragraph
# states either is on the sheet or is not, which makes invention and omission
# checkable the same way a rewrite's over-application is: by diffing against a
# source the judge can see.
#
# Same isolation as the rewrite loop and for the same reasons. The writer gets
# --setting-sources project, which loads the contract and the prose skill while
# dropping this machine's hooks. The judge gets --bare, which loads no CLAUDE.md
# at all, so it holds only the catalog its own prompt carries.
#
# prompts/comply.txt needs no changes. It already grades an EDITED text against an
# ORIGINAL with no assumption that the original was prose: a violation is a banned
# span in the paragraph, and an over-application is a fact the sheet carried that
# the paragraph lost or flattened, which is the same "protected span the editor
# changed anyway" the rewrite loop already grades, read against a sheet instead of
# a paragraph.
#
# promptfoo exec provider. Receives the fact sheet as $1 and prints one artifact
# carrying the paragraph, the writer's notes, and the findings, in the same shape
# rewrite-then-comply.sh uses, so tools/comply-report.py needs no changes either.
