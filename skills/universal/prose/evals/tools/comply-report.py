"""Triages a compliance run by diffing the editor's notes against the judge's findings.

The two enumerations disagree in four distinct ways, and each one points at a
different repair in the contract. That is the whole reason both sides enumerate.

    fired-then-over-applied   The editor applied rule R and the judge says
                              an exemption covered the span. The exemption is
                              too weak, or its markers read as an unconditional
                              ban.

    held-then-violation       The editor declined to apply R on an exemption and
                              the judge says the exemption did not reach. The
                              exemption is too broad.

    unseen-violation          The judge cites R and R appears nowhere in the
                              trace. The editor never noticed, so R's markers
                              are incomplete or the rule is not reaching it.

    self-inflicted            The violating span is absent from the original, so
                              the rewrite created it. The highest-value class,
                              because the contract caused the defect it bans.

Cases where the judge reported nothing need no reading and are counted only.
