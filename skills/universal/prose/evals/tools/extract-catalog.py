"""Pulls the prose-contract out of the global instruction file.

The contract names itself. `<prose-contract>` wraps `How to Write`, `Banned Patterns in
All Writing` and `Ghostwriting for Other Humans`, which the contract calls "the contract
for a written artifact". The persona, the evidence rules, the audience table and the chat
register sit outside the tag, because a compliance judge grading a written artifact has no
use for them and every extra section is context the judge can wander into.

Cutting on the tag rather than on three heading strings means a renamed heading no longer
breaks extraction, and the boundary is stated in the file rather than restated here.

Every rule inside the block carries a `PC-` id as its first token. Those ids are the shared
vocabulary between the contract, `cases/*.csv`, and anything that reports a finding.

Source of truth is the dotfiles repo, which is a parent of this one. Override with
CONTRACT_FILE when running from somewhere else.

Usage
