"""Fails when the contract and the case files disagree about what a rule is called.

Before ids, every place that named a rule typed it out. Two sessions naming the same rule
produced two strings, and the counting code treated them as two rules. One measured run
scored `trailing supplements` at 3 and `trailing supplements that hang a second beat on a
finished clause` at 3 instead of one rule at 6, and it did that to three rules.
`evals/CLAUDE.md` records the same failure in the case files, where a typo in the `bullet`
column "silently creates a new bullet".

Four checks, each catching a different way the two can drift.

    unknown id       A `bullet` value in cases/*.csv names an id the contract does not have
    orphan rule      A rule in the contract has no id at all, or carries two
    duplicate id     Two rules claim the same id
    dangling move    A [move N] tag points at a move How to Write does not define

An id with no case row is reported but does not fail, because a rule is allowed to exist
before anyone writes a case for it.
